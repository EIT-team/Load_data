# Functional Tests

`Test_ScouseTom.m` tests require the files from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4783547.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4783547) to be placed in the data directory as the EEG system files get very big very quickly. These tests only check that the code is functional and are by no means unit tests.

### Filter tests
Checks to characterise frequency dependence of filtering method. Historical curiosity more than anything else.
