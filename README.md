# Load Data
Software to load EIT data from the three systems into Matlab

-   [ScouseTom](https://github.com/EIT-team/ScouseTom) - Developed in UCL lab, and the focus of this repository. Based around a Keithley 6221 current source and EEG recording system. This system is open source and further details are given in [this repo](https://github.com/EIT-team/ScouseTom)
-   [KHU Mk 2.5](http://iirc.khu.ac.kr/) - Multi-Frequency EIT system. Helpful software for using this system can be found [here](https://github.com/Jimbles/KHU-UCL-EIT)
-   [SwissTom](http://www.swisstom.com/) - Specifically the Pioneer set

# Using this repository

## Installation
Run the installer script `load_data_installer.m`, which installs the `biosig` library and adds the relevant directories to the matlab path. Run the command `savepath` afterwards to avoid having to do this again.

## Loading ScouseTom data

### Biosig library
To load data from the ScouseTom system first requires installation of the version of the `biosig` library *found in this repository* [here](./lib/). This was modified to save RAM when loading huge files.

### Processing
The data is then processed by calling the function `ScouseTom_LoadBV.m` and directing it at a `.bdf` or `.eeg` file.

### Other systems

The **KHU** and **SwissTom** systems require only `Matlab`. The **KHU**
system may require some extra input from the user if they are some information missing in the scanning directory. This can be entered manually, or is auto generated by the code [here](https://github.com/Jimbles/KHU-UCL-EIT).

# Example Datasets

Small datasets for all three systems can be found [here](./resources/data) which example processing code found [here](./examples)
