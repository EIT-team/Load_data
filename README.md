Software to load EIT data from the three systems into Matlab

-   [ScouseTom](https://github.com/EIT-team/ScouseTom) - Developed in UCL lab, and the focus of this repository. Based around a Keithley 6221 current source and EEG recording system. This system is open source and further details are given in [this repository](https://github.com/EIT-team/ScouseTom)
-   [KHU Mk 2.5](http://iirc.khu.ac.kr/) - Multi-Frequency EIT system. Helpful software for using this system can be found [here](https://github.com/Jimbles/KHU-UCL-EIT)
-   [SwissTom](http://www.swisstom.com/) - Specifically the Pioneer set

# Using this repository

## Installation
Run the installer script `load_data_installer.m`, which installs the `biosig` library and adds the relevant directories to the matlab path. Run the command `savepath` afterwards to avoid having to do this again. **DO NOT** just add the lib folder as `biosig` contains lots of duplicate code.

## Loading ScouseTom data

### Biosig library
To load data from the ScouseTom system first requires installation of the version of the `biosig` library *found in this repository* [here](./lib/). This was modified to save RAM when loading huge files.

### Processing
The data is then processed by calling the function `ScouseTom_LoadBV.m` and directing it at a `.bdf` or `.eeg` file.

### Other systems

The **KHU** and **SwissTom** systems require only 'normal' `Matlab`.

The **KHU** data can be loaded using `KHU_Load.m`. Some extra input from the user may be required if there is information missing in the scanning directory. This can be entered manually, or is auto generated by the code [here](https://github.com/Jimbles/KHU-UCL-EIT).

The **SwissTom** data is loaded using the file `SwissTom_Load.m` and should be self contained.

# Example Datasets

Small datasets for all three systems can be found in [/resources/data](./resources/data) with accompanying example usage of the processing code found in [/example](./example)
