# Load Data
Software to load EIT data from the three systems into Matlab

-   [ScouseTom](https://github.com/EIT-team/ScouseTom) - Developed in UCL lab, and the focus of this repository. Based around a Keithley 6221 current source and EEG recording system. This system is open source and further details are given in [this repo](https://github.com/EIT-team/ScouseTom)
-   [KHU Mk 2.5](http://iirc.khu.ac.kr/) - Multi-Frequency EIT system. Helpful software for using this system can be found [here](https://github.com/Jimbles/KHU-UCL-EIT)
-   [SwissTom](http://www.swisstom.com/) - Specifically the Pioneer set

# Using this repository

## Loading ScouseTom data
To load data from the ScouseTom system first requires installation of the version of the `biosig` library *found in this repository* [here](./lib/).  Then by calling the function `ScouseTom_LoadBV.m` are directing it at a `.bdf` or `.eeg` file.


### Other systems

The **KHU** and **SwissTom** systems require only `Matlab`. The **KHU**
system may require some extra input from the user if they are some information missing in the scanning directory. This can be entered manually, or is auto generated by the code [here](https://github.com/Jimbles/KHU-UCL-EIT).
